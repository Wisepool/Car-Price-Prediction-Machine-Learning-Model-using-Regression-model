# Car Price Prediction Machine Learning Model ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the price of a used car based on user inputs like brand, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Project Structure

- **`Untitled.ipynb`** â€“ Contains code for:
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Model training using `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`  
  - Model evaluation  
  - Saving the trained model to `model.pkl` using `pickle`  

- **`app.py`** â€“ A Streamlit web app that:
  - Loads the trained model  
  - Takes user inputs from the sidebar and main interface  
  - Processes the inputs to match the trained modelâ€™s expected format  
  - Predicts the car price based on the inputs  
  - Displays the predicted price in real time  

- **`cardetails.csv`** â€“ The dataset used for training and testing.

- **`model.pkl`** â€“ The saved trained Linear Regression model.
