Car Price Prediction Machine Learning Model ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the price of a used car based on user inputs like brand, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.

ðŸ”§ Project Structure
Untitled.ipynb â€“ Contains code for:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training using LinearRegression from scikit-learn

Model evaluation

Saving the trained model to model.pkl using pickle

app.py â€“ A Streamlit web application that:

Loads the trained model

Takes user inputs from the sidebar and main interface

Processes the inputs to match the trained modelâ€™s expected format

Predicts car price based on user inputs

Displays the predicted price in real-time

cardetails.csv â€“ The dataset used for training and testing the model.

model.pkl â€“ The serialized trained Linear Regression model.
